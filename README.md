# Cuneiform Text Library
A collection of texts written in cuneiform presented _in_ cuneiform.

This project takes online resources in cuneiform that have been transliterated into Latin script and
transliterates them back into cuneiform using Unicode. This makes these stories and texts accessible in
their original form online in the 21st century.

The code uses a simple [dictionary](https://github.com/Communio-Templorum/cuneiform-text-corpus/blob/master/src/cuneiform.json)
to transliterate the sign names into Unicode.

The original texts/stories, in their original language, are in the public domain and I believe the
transliterated text would be, too. Regardless, I contend this project falls fully within the United
States' doctrine of transformative fair use.

Any English translations used in this project either are simple definitions of individual words, were
taken from a source in the public domain, or were published with permission from the original
translator and properly cited.
